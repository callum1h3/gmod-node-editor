# gmod-node-editor
Unfinished gmod pathfinding using nodes.

This project is a client side lua file that allows the user to go into editor mode to place nodes around the map kinda like how hammer does path finding with bots however my version has alot more features such as node types that can get the bot to perform specific tasks and live testing aswell. I got bored of developing this so unfinished files are here.
